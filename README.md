# Broadcast_variables_scala

* The broadcast variables are read only shared variables that are cached and available on all nodes in a cluster in order to access or use by tasks.
* Rather than sending this variable to every node along with the data spark distributes these variables to the machines using efficient broadcast algorithms 
  to reduce data traffic and costs.
* These variables are serialized in the cache and deserialized before accessed.
